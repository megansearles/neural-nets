    "Here's my implementation of a regular feed-forward network.  I've implemented it as a class called ```neural_net```.  When it's called it takes as arguments a list of integers, which specifies the number of nodes at each layer.  For example, ```neural_net(5,7,3)``` creates a neural network with 5 input neurons, a single hidden layer with 7 neurons, and 3 outpute neurons.  ```neural_net(5,5,5,5,5)``` is a neural net with input, output, and 3 hidden layers, with 5 neurons at each layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since there's a number of ways to set things up (and mine might be slightly different than the way you did it), I'll explain here the details of my setup.  Each data point (training or testing) will be in the form of a column vector.  For example, let $X$ be a single input vector with $n$ features.  To find the resulting activations at the second layer of neurons (the first hidden layer) we multiply $X$ by the weight matrix $W$.  If there are $n$ input neurons and $m$ neurons in the hidden layer, then $W$ will be $m$ by $n$.  Thus, the values of the activations at the first hidden layer (before applying the activation function) is just given by the matrix product $WX$.  So to find the value of the activation at the first neuron in the hidden layer, we take the first row of $W$ and take the dot product with the vector $X$, the activation at the second neuron is obtained by taking the second row of $W$ and dotting with the vector $X$, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Doing it like this, we could incorporate bias terms explicitly, but adding on a separate vector of biases, say $B$, to $WX$, but in the code below I've implemented it slightly differently.  Instead of adding the bias vector $B$ onto $WX$, I insert the $B$ into the front of the matrix $W$, so that it is now an $m$ by $n+1$ matrix with first column $B$, and I turn $X$ into a $n+1$ dimensional vector, by adding a 1 in the first spot (notice that the dimensions still work out for the matrix multiplication).  It shouldn't be hard to convince yourself that modifying $X$ and $W$ in this way is the same thing as adding on the bias terms separately.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can do the same after applying the activation function when going from the first hidden layer to the next layer, by using a matrix $W$ with one extra column (corresponding to the biases).  Notice though that this requires the extra step of putting an extra 1 in the first spot of the neuron vector at each layer before multiplying by $W$.\n",
    "\n",
    "One final thing, note that in the discussion above $X$ could have consisted of $k$ observations, in which case it would have been an $n \\times k$ matrix.  In this case, the formulas all hold the same, but at each layer you'll have a list of $k$ vectors which contain the values of the corresponding neurons for each of the $k$ input vectors.  Instead of adding a single 1 to the first position to account for the biases, we'll have to add a row of 1s at each step to the matrix $X$."
